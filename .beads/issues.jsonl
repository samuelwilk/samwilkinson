MORE WHITESPACE\n   - Increase gaps between collection cards significantly (inspiration: showcase panels have massive negative space)\n   - Reduce number of columns or increase container max-width to give images more breathing room\n   - Add generous padding around the grid area\n\n2. SUBTLE TILT/JITTER (like showcase slots)\n   - Apply random subtle rotation to each collection card (±0.5 to 1.5 degrees)\n   - Keep rotation consistent per collection (deterministic based on collection slug)\n   - Similar to showcase slot rotations but more restrained for grid context\n\n3. MUSEUM-STYLE LABELS\n   - Replace bottom metadata section with overlaid museum label (like showcase photos)\n   - Label should show: Collection name, location, year\n   - Position: bottom-left corner of image (not below)\n   - Style: bg-bone/90 backdrop-blur-sm with persimmon left border\n   - Font: mono for location/year, display for name\n   - Keep label visible on card (not just on hover)\n\n4. REFINED INTERACTION\n   - Remove border and rounded corners (showcase has none)\n   - Keep subtle shadow or use none\n   - On hover: slight lift (translateY) instead of scale\n   - Maintain lazy loading and current masonry positioning\n\n5. VISUAL CONSISTENCY\n   - Match showcase aesthetic: warm minimalism, MCM/Eames influence, prairie lines\n   - Use same paper grain background (already present)\n   - Maintain object-cover for images\n   - Keep persimmon accent color for interactive states\n\nTECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- Symfony 7.4 + Twig + Tailwind + Stimulus\n- Must preserve existing stills-masonry controller functionality\n- Keep lazy loading implementation\n- Maintain responsive breakpoints (mobile: 1 col, tablet: 2 col, desktop: 3 col)\n- Collections are from {% for collection in collections %} loop\n- Collection data: name, slug, locationName, startDate, photoCount, coverPhoto\n\nUSE frontend-design skill to implement this design enhancement.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-30T00:15:13.241549-06:00","created_by":"sam","updated_at":"2025-12-30T00:19:21.131411-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T00:19:21.131453-06:00"}
